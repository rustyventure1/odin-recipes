        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
            <li>Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldnâ€™t be hot.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Please read the recipe note about properly measuring flour.</li>
            <li>Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky</li>
            <li>Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.</li>
            <li>Let cool for 5 minutes and garnish with flaky sea salt</li>
        </ol>
